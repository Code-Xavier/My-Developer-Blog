# Hello, World!

### Day Three: Even More Portfolio Struggles - and Finally, a Triumph!

Spent some more time working on a new portfolio - this one made from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has basically taken me all day in between other activities, but at least it's done.

I used a tutorial from [Ania Kubow](https://www.youtube.com/c/AniaKub%C3%B3w) to ge the header and the light/dark mode switch, and then created the projects and about me sections through much trial and error, google searches, and banging my head against the keyboard.

It's been a long day.

And I didn't get everything done that I wanted.

But well, such is life. At least now I have a portfolio I'm proud of, and which I truly created myself from the ground up. I know every line of code in this thing. And that's a good feeling in itself.

Anyway... it's 10 PM.

Time to hit the springs.

So here's my third screenshot in the `#100daysofcode` challenge:
