# Hello, World!

### Day Two: Portfolio Struggles

Spent some time working on my portfolio - it gave me a lot of headaches, the gatsby starter code just constantly throwing compilation errors, or not displaying properly on mobile.

I might have to create an entirely new portfolio, but I definitely learned a lot in the process - and that, after all, is the point ðŸ’¯.

What I think i'll do is just create a simple design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - you know, the basics i'm actually truly familiar with, rather than dabbling in that which i do not fully understand.

But first, I want to focus on getting my JavaScript and React fundementals down.

Once I have that, and still have time left this week, then I'll work on the portfolio.

Or if i'm feeling very dedicated, wake up 3 AM and get it done before the day starts.

But we shall see - baby steps.

So here's my second screenshot in the `#100daysofcode` challenge:
