# Hello, World!

### Welcome to my first blog post!

After several hours of fighting with my code, I finally have this blog up and running. I'm still working on the content, but I'm pretty happy with the overall look of the site.

Now I still have to go and fix my portfolio, and the game-room idea I have (more on that in another post), and it's already 8:00 PM.

I've spent a bucketload of time on the about page, and trying to get flag emojis, and the logo to display something else - all aesthetic things that don't matter that much and can always fixed later.

I have to learn not to do that.

I have to focus on what's important.
What is necessary for deploying something online.
And leave the rest to be done later.

So here's my first screenshot in the `#100daysofcode` challenge:

Day 1: Set up my developer portfolio and developer blog, where I'll be documenting the #100daysofcode challenge, and my progress in JavaScript and Python üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm going to be making smaller posts liek this on instagram (themusicalcoder) as well, and probably start linking my blog on those posts as well.

Humble beginnings, but starting somewhere is the point.

9:00 PM

I've finally more or less got my portfolio page in order.

You can see it here: [xaviervaloissmith.com](http://xaviervaloissmith.com)

This is only the beginning.

Having this blog, and sharing it with my developer friends, will create a kind of accountability for me - more than just my eyes are watching my progress. Don't dissapoint!

Keep striving.

Keep learning.

And most importantly.

Be consistent.
